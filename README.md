# NoiseMaker PHP Framework

## Purpose of this project
Does the world need yet another PHP framework? Not at all. This is not why
I started coding this. This project began while experimenting with URL routing
and pretty URL structure. First I wrote the router, then next a dispatcher. It didn't
take very long before I found myself writing more features and fundamental functionality
as a means to understand how frameworks like CakePHP worked on a basic level.

The purpose of this project was purely learning. Over the next while I will develop
documentation, and expand on ideas I have had previously.

One of the key things I've learned from this project (which may seem extremely basic)
is the importance of comments in code. While code may seem incredibly obvious when it's
being written; as little as 3 months later it can seem incredibly foreign!
Comment *ALL* the things. Lesson learned.
